* Lecture 6
** Compressive vs expansive function
- Functions all monotonically increasing
- If input is increasing *faster* than output, function is compressive
- Otherwise,
- eg exponential - compressive 0 < alpha < 1 and expansive > 1
** Sigmoid functions
- Map R onto [0, 1]
- -inf = 0, +inf = 1
- e.g. the *logistic function*
- Logistic function is expansive < 0, compressive > 0
- $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
- Gradient is a bell curve
