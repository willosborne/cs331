# CS331 Neural Computing
A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron solving the XOR problem. Nothing fancy, but brought some interesting challenges with it.

If you're reading this, you should be on the right branch for DCS stuff.
Requirements:
 - Python 2.7 (**not** 3.x, that will not work)
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - sklearn
 - tensorflow
 - keras
 
 Any sane Python should have `pip` - just use `pip install ...` on each package.
 
 Many thanks!
