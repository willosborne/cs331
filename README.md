# CS331 Neural Computing - master branch

Please switch to the DCS-version branch. This version will not run on DCS machines (should do on up to date ones, though!) and is not commented.

You can do that with the bar in the top left above the file list in GitHub, or with this command:

`git checkout --track -b DCS-version origin/DCS-version`

Many thanks!
